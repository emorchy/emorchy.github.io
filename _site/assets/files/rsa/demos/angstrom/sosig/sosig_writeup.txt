By using a large e, e^-1 mod totient n would be a small d.
Using Wiener's attack, d can be found.

import owiener
d = owiener.attack(e, n)
Decrypt c to the power of d mod n: pow(c,d,n)
from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes
long_to_bytes(m) # The plaintext number becomes the flag

d = 14698244184759005359
m = b'actf{d0ggy!!!111!1}'
